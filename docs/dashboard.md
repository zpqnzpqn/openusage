# Dashboard

The popover that opens from the menu bar icon. Providers are sections; each section shows the metrics you've enabled.

Each provider card leads with its **always-shown** metrics. Any metrics you've moved below the **Shown on Expand** line are tucked away behind the in-card caret — click it to reveal them below the caret, click again to collapse. Open cards stay open across popover closes and app restarts. A provider with nothing tucked away shows no caret.

When you expand a card, the tucked-away metrics open below the caret as a single-column list, so each detail row keeps the full card width.

A provider card can also show **quick-link buttons** pinned at the bottom of its expanded section — Status, Console, Dashboard, and the like — that open the provider's own pages in your default browser. They're part of the expander, so collapsing the caret hides them along with the tucked-away metrics. Buttons lay out up to three across, wrapping to a second row when there are more.

## Rows

**Metrics with a limit** (session, weekly, credits with a cap) show a progress bar with:

- A fill whose color is a verdict on the whole window, based on your current burn rate: blue while you're on course to finish with at least 10% to spare, yellow when you're projected to land inside the last 10% with a little cushion to spare, red when you're projected to run out before the reset — or to finish right at the limit with nothing to spare. So a half-full bar burning too fast is already red, and a nearly-drained bar coasting to the reset stays blue. Bars without a reset window (like a credit balance), and fresh windows too young to project, color by the level itself instead: yellow once 80% is used, red once 10% or less is left. The colors come from the system palette, so they adapt to light/dark and accessibility settings, and they never flip with the Used/Left toggle.
- A headline like `52% left` or `48% used`. **Click it** to flip between Used and Left everywhere — hovering shows the opposite reading.
- A reset label like `Resets in 3h 25m` or `Resets today at 6:38 PM`. **Click it** to flip between countdown and exact time everywhere — hovering shows the other format.
- A blue bar carries nothing extra by default. With **Always Show Pacing** on (Settings), it also shows an even-pace tick on the bar and a quiet `~35% left at reset` note next to the metric name.
- A yellow bar adds a `~3% spare` note right-aligned next to the metric name, plus the even-pace tick on the bar (where usage would sit if you burned evenly across the window). That cushion is always at least 1%; if you're projected to finish with nothing to spare it turns red instead (so a yellow bar never reads `~0% spare`).
- A red bar swaps the note for a red flame next to the metric name with the projected run-out time — `Limit in 3h 5m` or `Limit today at 11:49 PM`, following the same countdown/exact format as the reset label — and still shows the even-pace tick on the bar. **Click the time** to flip the format everywhere, just like clicking the reset label. When you're projected to finish right at the limit — no run-out before the reset, just no cushion left — the flame shows alone with no time.
- Once the balance is spent — actually empty, or so close it rounds to `0` (like `0% left` or `$0.00`) — the bar stays red and the flame reads `Limit reached`, no matter how gentle the burn rate looked. A visibly empty bar never shows a calmer color.
- **Hover the bar**, the spare note, or the flame for the pace projection at reset — the one number not already on the row: a blue bar shows the cushion you're on course to finish with (`~35% left at reset`), a yellow bar the usage it complements the spare note with (`~92% used at reset`), a red bar how far past the limit you're projected to land (`~12% over limit at reset`, or `~100% used at reset` when you're projected to finish right at it). Once spent it reads `Limit reached`.

**Metrics without a limit** (daily spend, balances) show as a single line like `$4.08 spent` or `1.2M tokens`. The daily spend rows (Today / Yesterday / Last 30 Days) come in three flavors you can add from Customize — cost (`$4.08 spent`), tokens (`1.2M tokens`), or both (`$4.08 · 1.2M tokens`). A day with no usage is a real zero, so it reads `$0.00 · 0 tokens` (not "No data" — that's only when the data can't be loaded at all). Big numbers are abbreviated to keep rows tidy (`$2.06K`, `1.5B`) — hover the value to see the exact figures and source note, such as a local estimate.

**Usage Trend** (Claude, Codex, and Grok) is a small bar chart of the last 30 days of token usage — one bar per day, drawn from the same source as that provider's spend rows (the provider's local logs). **Hover it** for the peak day, the date range, and the source. It's on by default; turn it off or reorder it from Customize like any other metric. It can't be pinned to the menu bar — the strip shows single values, not a chart.

Rows with a reset date tick every 30 seconds, so countdowns and pace stay live between refreshes.

## Right-click menus

Every row: **Hide · Pin to menu bar / Unpin · Refresh \<provider\> · Customize…**
Provider headers: **Hide \<provider\> · Refresh \<provider\> · Customize…** (Hide turns the whole provider off; turn it back on under Settings ▸ Providers.) plus **Copy as Image** (see below).

## Share

Right-click a provider header and choose **Copy as Image** to copy a clean, branded PNG of that provider's usage to your clipboard, ready to paste into a chat, a tweet, or a doc.

The image is a flexible-height PNG using the app's look — the provider's mark and name up top, the metric rows you currently see for that provider, and a small OpenUsage mark centered at the bottom. It follows your Light/Dark appearance and shows everything on the card as-is (nothing is hidden or blurred).

## Footer

The bar pinned to the bottom of the popover. On the left: the app version, and a live "Next update in …" countdown you can click (or press **⌘R**) to refresh right away. On the right: a **Customize** button paired with a **⌄** menu. The menu holds the app-level actions — **Settings**, **Check for Updates…**, **About OpenUsage**, and **Quit OpenUsage**.

## Customize

Open Customize from the **⌄** menu next to the footer's Settings button (or press **Return**): toggle metrics on/off, add ones that aren't placed yet, pin metrics for the menu bar, and drag to reorder. Drag-reorder also works directly on the dashboard — drag a row within its provider, drag it across the caret boundary while the card is open, or drag a provider header to reorder sections. On a Force Touch trackpad you'll feel a light tap each time the dragged item snaps into a new slot.

Each provider card has a dashed **Shown on Expand** line. Metrics above it are always shown; metrics below it hide behind the dashboard caret. Drag a metric onto the dashed line to move it across the fold, or drag it onto a row on the other side — drop a metric under an expanded one and it becomes expanded too. Pinning, hiding, and order all work the same on either side.

The default reset layout keeps each provider's core quota meters and Usage Trend always shown, then tucks balances, reset details, and spend-history rows behind the caret. Optional detail rows like Claude Sonnet and Cursor Requests/Credits stay off by default, but start below the divider if you enable them.

When OpenUsage ships a new default metric, existing layouts get it once. If you turn it off, it stays off. The **Reset** button in Customize restores the default metrics, order, menu-bar pins, and which metrics start behind the expand caret, but leaves provider settings and other preferences unchanged.

## Keyboard

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| Return | Open / close Customize |
| Esc | Back out of Customize or Settings; from the dashboard, close the popover |
| ⌘R | Refresh now (skips the cache) |
| ⌘, | Open / close Settings (in the popover) |

A global shortcut (recorded in Settings) toggles the popover from anywhere.

## Closing

Closing the popover resets navigation state: scroll position returns to the top and Customize / Settings close. Provider cards remember whether their expand caret was open.
