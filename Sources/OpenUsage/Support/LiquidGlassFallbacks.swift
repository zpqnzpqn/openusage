/// Availability-gated wrappers for the handful of macOS 26 (Tahoe) Liquid Glass APIs the popover

/// macOS 15 (Sequoia).
///
/// These are purely cosmetic fallbacks — they swap Liquid Glass styling for the established
/// pre-Tahoe controls (`.bordered` button styles, `.safeAreaInset`, no scroll-edge blur). Function
/// is preserved on every supported OS: the footer still pins, the buttons keep their active/inactive
/// distinction, the scroll view still scrolls. Nothing here hides a runtime error — each branch is a
/// compile-time `#available` check, which is the intended way to back-deploy newer-SDK APIs.
///
/// These gate purely on OS version. The popover backdrop is opaque by default (`PopoverBackdropView`'s
/// opaque tray, matching `Theme.traySurface`); the opt-in Increase Transparency mode crossfades it to a
/// behind-window vibrancy view so the desktop shows through, and the cards swap to a frosted standard
/// material. Either way glass stays reserved for the footer chrome — its `.bar`/glass bar plus the
/// interactive glass controls — never the content cards.
///
/// Keeping every `#available(macOS 26, *)` check in this one file means the views (`HeaderView`,
/// `SettingsScreen`, `DashboardView`) stay free of inline availability branches.
