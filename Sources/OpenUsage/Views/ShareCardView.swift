/// expanded), drawn at the popover's own scale and rasterized at ×4 for a crisp, large share image.

/// The layout is intentionally not a fixed canvas: the card height grows with its rows, so a collapsed
/// provider exports a short card and an expanded one a tall one, with little wasted whitespace. The view
/// takes already-resolved `[WidgetData]` (not a store), so it has no environment dependency and renders
/// the same way in the app and in tests. It paints an opaque `Theme.traySurface` background (an
/// `ImageRenderer` has no window backdrop) and forces the appearance via `.environment(\.colorScheme, …)`
