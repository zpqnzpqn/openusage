## v0.7.0

**A brand-new OpenUsage.** The app has been rebuilt from the ground up to be faster, lighter, and feel right at home on your Mac.

> **Coming from an earlier version?** This is a fresh start. Your usage and sign-ins are still read straight from your machine — but the app and its look are all new.

### Highlights

- **Rebuilt for Mac** — quicker to open, lighter to run, and a clean, modern look. Runs on macOS Sequoia and later, on both Apple Silicon and Intel Macs.
- **More providers** — Claude, Codex, Cursor, Grok, Devin, and Antigravity, all in one place.
- **Usage trends** — a quick sparkline of recent usage for Claude, Codex, Cursor, and Grok.
- **Pacing** — see whether you're ahead or behind, with a "Limit in 3h 45m" estimate and an optional always-on view.
- **Clearer spend** — cost and tokens shown side by side, with a clean "$0.00 · 0 tokens" when there's nothing to show yet.
- **Codex limit resets** — see when your limits refresh, right in the menu bar and popover.
- **Make it yours** — resize the panel, expand extra metrics, reorder providers, pin your favorites to the menu bar, and right-click for quick actions.
- **Private by default** — optional, anonymous usage and crash reporting you can turn off anytime.

### New in this release

- **Your settings now stick** — updating no longer resets your layout, pins, and preferences.
- **More reliable Claude sign-in** — steadier connection and clearer messages when something needs attention.
- **Cursor** — spend is temporarily hidden while Cursor's own usage data is delayed, so you don't see misleading numbers.
- Smaller fixes and polish throughout.

## v0.7.0-beta.13
